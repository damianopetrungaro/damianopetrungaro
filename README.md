### Ciao 👋


I'm an Italian philosopher, ego-less software, and community enthusiast.

I am living in Italy and remote-working for [@messagebird](https://github.com/messagebird/).

Previously, I worked [@hellofresh](https://github.com/hellofresh/), and I'm maintaining [@conventional commits](https://github.com/conventional-commits/) and [@laravel italia](https://github.com/laravel-italia/).

I've been writing code since 2015 and I spent my last two years writing Go;
I used to write PHP, please don't ask me why 😅.
