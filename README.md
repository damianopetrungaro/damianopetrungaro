### Ciao ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Dam**, an ego-less engineer, [speaker](https://sessionize.com/damianopetrungaro/#events), open-source maintainer, mentor, and all-around community enthusiast hailing from Italy.

I live in Milan, and I'm currently working as a Staff Engineer/Engineering Manager [@joinodin](https://github.com/joinodin/).

Before my time at Odin,
I had the pleasure to lead some incredible teams at [@messagebird](https://github.com/messagebird/), [@hellofresh](https://github.com/hellofresh/), and [@pento](https://github.com/pentohq/).

One of my contributions is maintaining [@conventional commits](https://github.com/conventional-commits/), a popular convention for structuring commit messages.
